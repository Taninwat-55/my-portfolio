In product management, we often talk about **"Product-Market Fit."** But we rarely apply that same rigorous lens to our own careers.

Here is how I treated my portfolio as a product, identified a churn problem, and pivoted for better conversion.

### The "Genesis Block" Problem

My previous portfolio was technically impressive. It featured 3D interactive elements using Three.js, a horizontal scroll system inspired by blockchain ledgers, and a heavy "Bitcoin" aesthetic. It was cool. It was unique.

**But it had a fatal UX flaw:** It prioritized "novelty" over "clarity."

When I analyzed the user journey of a recruiter or a hiring manager, I realized they aren't looking for hidden easter eggs. They have about **30 seconds** to answer three questions:

1.  Can this person build scalable software?
2.  Do they understand business value?
3.  Are they professional enough to put in front of stakeholders?

My old portfolio screamed "Hobbyist." I needed one that screamed "Professional."

### The Pivot: FinTech Minimalism

I decided to refactor my personal brand. I moved away from the "Bitcoin Enthusiast" vibe toward a **"Product Engineer"** aesthetic—clean, typographic, and data-driven. Think Stripe, Vercel, or Linear.

> "Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent. I wanted my portfolio to get out of the way and let the work speak for itself."

### Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

Migrating from a client-side Vite app to **Next.js 14** wasn't just a trend-chasing move; it was a performance optimization strategy.

- **SEO & Discovery:** Moving to Server Side Rendering (SSR) ensures that search crawlers can index my case studies effectively.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** I replaced the custom horizontal scroll hijacking with standard vertical scrolling. This respects user agency and native browser behaviors.
- **Performance:** By removing heavy 3D libraries, I reduced the First Contentful Paint (FCP) significantly, respecting the user's data and battery life.

### Conclusion

This redesign represents who I am today: A developer who can write complex code, but a Product Manager who knows when _not_ to. 

Welcome to v2.0. Let's build something that matters.
