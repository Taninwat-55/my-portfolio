When you build side projects, your "users" are usually you and your localhost. When you build for a real client, your users are paying customers. The stakes are different.

My first real freelance project was for **Racha Beauty & Wellness**, a small spa and massage business in Næstved. The owner needed a digital presence that matched the calming, professional atmosphere of her salon.

I thought the challenge would be CSS animations. I was wrong. The real challenge was **infrastructure reliability**.

### The Technical Trap: Nodemailer & Cold Starts

To keep costs low for the client, I initially built a custom contact form using **Nodemailer** hosted on a free-tier server instance. It worked perfectly during development.

But a few days after launch, the client called me: _"My customers say the contact form isn't working."_

**The Problem:** The free server had a "cold start" policy. If no one visited the site for a while, the server went to sleep. When a customer tried to send a booking inquiry, the request would time out before the server woke up to send the email.

**The Impact:** Lost leads. For a small business, every missed email is missed revenue.

### The Pivot: Web3Forms

I realized I was over-engineering. I didn't need a custom backend server just to send emails.

I migrated the system to **Web3Forms**, a dedicated form backend service.

- **Cost:** Free (250 submissions/month), which was perfect for Racha's volume.
- **Reliability:** 100% uptime. No cold starts. No sleeping servers.

### Client Communication: The Real Skill

The most important part wasn't the code change; it was the communication. I didn't bore Racha with details about "server hydration states."

I told her: _"The initial email system was going into 'power-saving mode,' which caused delays. I've switched to a specialized email vendor that guarantees instant delivery, 24/7, at no extra cost to you."_

She didn't care about the stack. She cared that her bookings were safe.

### Conclusion

This project was my crash course in **Production Engineering**. It taught me that "free" often has a hidden cost, and that as a developer, my job isn't just to write code—it's to protect my client's business continuity.
