In economics, we study **opportunity cost**. In frontend development, we study **latency**. They are the same thing.

Every millisecond a user waits for your app to load is a "tax" on their attention span. If that tax gets too high, they churn. As a Product Engineer, I don't just look at Lighthouse scores as vanity metrics—I look at them as revenue indicators.

### The "100ms" Rule

Amazon found that every 100ms of latency cost them **1% in sales**. Google found that an extra 0.5 seconds in search page generation dropped traffic by **20%**.

When I build a feature, I ask three questions:

1.  **Does this spark joy?** (UX)
2.  **Does this solve a problem?** (Product)
3.  **Does the "weight" of this feature justify the "wait" for the user?** (Performance Economics)

### Why I Moved to Next.js (The Business Case)

My decision to migrate this portfolio from a client-side SPA (Vite) to **Next.js** wasn't just about using the latest tech. It was a calculated move to improve **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**.

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** The browser downloads a blank page, then a huge JS bundle, _then_ renders. The user stares at a white screen. **Result:** High bounce rate.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The server sends a fully formed HTML page instantly. **Result:** Immediate perceived value.

### Optimizing for the "Next" User

Technical debt isn't just bad code; it's a bad product strategy.

By obsessing over **Core Web Vitals**—optimizing images to WebP, lazy-loading heavy components, and code-splitting routes—I am respecting the user's time.

In a crowded market, you don't always win by having the _most_ features. Sometimes, you win simply by being the _fastest_ to solve the problem.
